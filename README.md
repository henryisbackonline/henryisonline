# Henry is Online

This is my blog. It's based on the [eleventy-base-blog-v9](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog/) template, since it seems to have all the necessary features I require to run a basic blog.

I plan to:
- add my own css
- remove all the attribues and files I don't need from the repository
- modify the structure of the repository to better match my needs
- start a simple blog with these components
- learn about [eleventy](https://11ty.dev) as I go.

This will by my way of getting started with web development. I have some rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I want to expand my knowledge of both of those langueas, as well as learn the Nunjucks templaiong lenguage, since it seems very popular and useful.

Ultimately, I want to use eleventy as little as possible. I would prefer to have my site built with as much startic HTML as I can, annd use eleventy only to update an Archive page, a Recent Posts section on my home page, and enable me to drop in some markdown files where I want them to go and transform them into html for me. Over time, as I learn more about HTML, CSS, and eleventy, I hope I can push my blog in that direction.
