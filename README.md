# Henry is Online

This is the source code for my blog. It uses [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)

This will by my way of getting started with web development. I have some rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I want to expand my knowledge of both of those languages, as well as learn the Nunjucks templating language, since it seems very popular and useful. Learning some JavaScript through the use of Eleventy would also be good.
