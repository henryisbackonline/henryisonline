[Joan Westenberg](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/) is one of my favourite writers. Her work is inspiring to me, and is part of the reason that I made a blog in the first place. I recently found her article "[The Case for Blogging in the Ruins](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-case-for-blogging-in-the-ruins/)" through a [post by Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/blog/the-case-for-blogging-in-the-ruins/), and it encompasses may of the reasons I started blogging. I encourage everyone to read it. 

One line in particular stands out to me, and it's about people who, in Joan's words, "*have essentially stopped writing anything substantial because they've moved their entire intellectual presence to Twitter or Substack Notes.*" I've seen this too, and it's truly unfortunate. I've met lots of good people who have a lot of interesting things to say, and many of them have put their time and effort into consuming and fuelling social media algorithms.

Joan provides a list of blogging platforms at the end of her article, and encourages anyone who might be interest in blogging to give those platforms a try. I have another to recommend: [Pika](https://pika.page). It's how I got started with blogging, and it makes the whole process very easy and straightforward. Their free plan is very generous, as they give you your first 50 (*50!!*) posts for free. Pika is run by some truly incredible people, of which [Barry Hess](https://bjhess.com) is one (and the founder of [Good Enough](https://goodenough.us) — the small but wonderful company that runs Pika).

Start blogging. Make a place for yourself on the internet. Don't give Zuckerberg any more of your time or attention.
