I really think one of the things that’s stopping me from writing more is this strange idea that everything I make here has to be some impressive think piece, or reach some higher minimum word count than any of my threads.

I don’t think it could be further from the truth.

This is *my* blog, where *I* post things. There’s no set rules other than **I post what I want**. I like to write longer posts than what I typically write on threads, but that’s probably a good thing. Instant gratification from social media has done a number on my brain chemistry, and I’m really enjoying going back to an older, slower internet for a little bit while I get less online. If I’m being honest, I think a *lot* of people could benefit from a slower internet. It helps.

Ultimately, I want my place online to be a blog that I write, because writing this way definitely works better for my brain than Threads or Twitter (may she rest in peace) ever has. I’m slowly working on rewriting my thought processes to pursue more intentional internet use, and writing in a blog like this is going to be a big part of it. Focusing more of the quality of my time spent online, not the quantity. It’s a goal I’m working on slowly, but I’m making progress, which I’m happy about. I like where I am on the internet at the moment, and I want to keep this feeling around for as long as I can. It’s good to make stuff again.
