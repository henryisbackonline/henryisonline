First post here, and more of a test post than anything. I’ll tell you a little about me and what I plan to do here.

The _about_ has most of the interesting things about me covered, but I haven’t really said what I plan to do with this place. That's mostly because I’m not really sure. I’ve never had a blog before, much less one I’ve been inclined to use regularly, and my only experience with microblogging proper has been on Threads. I’ve yelled about some of my ideas over there, but I haven’t been able to go into too much detail because of the way that Threads is — what with character limits and all that. I want to use this space to write out some of my more complex thoughts and ideas that I feel are worth sharing with all the nuance and caveats and details they require.

I honestly feel like the last thing the world needs right now is another blog about consumer technology, so I’ll do my best to not do _that_. However, if I’ve learnt anything about myself, it’s that I am a Certain Way, so it’s entirely likely that it might devolve into _just that._ Mostly I’ll write about whatever I feel like, which I sincerely hope will be entertaining enough for you to stick around. Anyway.

Big Things Coming™, as the mediocre club DJs always say. I’m looking forward to writing more, and I’m keen to see what others have to say about what I have to say. Go read a bunch of other good blogs — it’s well worth it. You can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) and [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/) as @henryisonline. This used to say Threads, but now it doesn’t — I’ve come to detest Meta and their shenanigans. I have no idea how wrap these things up.

Here’s my stupid face from years ago.
