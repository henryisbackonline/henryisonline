_This post very late, and for that I am sorry. I started drafting this and then just about everything happened all once — I’ll provide a link here when I finally write about that. Regardless, I am finally publishing this, and I hope you enjoy._

Today I got excellent news. There are ~~three~~ ~~five~~ a whole bunch of new blogs on [Pika](https://pika.page/), and the people who made them are some of the most incredible people I’ve ever met online. Here they are:

- [Requiem Bay](https://requiembay.pika.page/)
    
- [Nomenclature](https://nomenclature.pika.page/)
    
- [Apocalyptography](https://apocalyptography.pika.page/)
    
- [Meanwhile The World](https://meanwhiletheworld.pika.page/)
    
- [Junk Drawer](https://junk.pika.page/)
    
- [Bazombo](https://bazombo.pika.page/)
    

I’m thrilled beyond measure that more people are taking up blogging. This medium has become so important to me over the last few years, and to have some truly excellent and funny people writing long form content is a dream come true.

To my fellow writers and friends, I love you all. To Barry and all of Good Enough, I’m incredibly appreciative of the platform you’ve created. And to anyone who reads anything on a blog, thank you. You’re helping more than you know, and your presence and attention being focused on independent writing and creation is so important.

This is how we fight back against social media algorithms and the increasing amount of AI generated garbage that exists all over the internet at the moment. This is how we win our attention back, and how we support the independent creators who keep pushing their ideas to the internet. This is how we make it out.

Thank you everyone, from the bottom of my heart. I’m so excited to see what comes next.
